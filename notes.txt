Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
    2. Resource light
    3. Error Handling
    4. Concurrency

    1. Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
        * No access modifiers (No public, private, protected etc)
        * No Classes (only structs)
        * No inheritance (only composition)
        * No Exceptions (only errors [values])
        * No "try catch finally"
        * No reference types (everything is a value in go)
        * No pointer arithmetic
        * No implicit type conversion
        * Has a builtin Garbage Collector

    2. Light Weight
        - Compiles to Native Code
        - No need for app servers
        - Performance on par with C++

    3. Concurrency
        - Goroutine (4 KB) / OS Thread (2 MB on linux)
            1000s of goroutines using fewer OS thread(s)
        - Has a builtin Scheduler to schedule the goroutines
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            "go" keyword, "chan" data type, "range" & "select case" constructs
        - SDK support
            sync package
            sync/atomic package

    Documentation for GO Standard Library
        https://pkg.go.dev/std

    To run a go program
        go run <program.go>

    To create a build
        go build <program.go>
        go build -o <buildname> <program.go>    

    To execute the build 
        In mac -> ./<buildname>
        IN windows -> <buildname> 

    To list all the environment variables
        go env

    To get the value of the given environment variables
        go env <env_variable>
        go env <env_variable-1> <env_variable-2>

    To change the environment variables
        go env -w <env_variable-1>=<value_1> <env_variable-2>=<value_2>

    Envrionment Variables for Cross Compilation
        GOOS & GOARCH
    
    To get the list of platforms for cross compilation
        go tool dist list 
            (will list the possible combination of GOOS/GOARCH)
    
    On Mac & Linux
        GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <program.go>

Assignment-1:  
    Print all the prime numbers between 3 and 100

Assignment-2:
    Display the following menu
		1. Add
		2. Subtract
		3. Multiply
		4. Divide
		5. Exit
	Accept the user choice
	If the user choice is 1 - 4
		accept 2 numbers from the user
		perform the corresponding operation
		print the result
		display the menu again

	If the user choice = 5
		print "Thank you"
		exit the application

	If the user choice is NOT 1 - 5
		print "Invalid choice"
		display the menu again


Functions
    variadic functions
    anonymous functions
    higher order functions (functions are first class objects)
        1. assign a function as a value to a variable
        2. pass a function as an argument to another function
        3. return a function as a return value from another function


Assignment-03:
    Refactor the solution for assignment-02 using functions
        NOTE: make sure that each function follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

Collections
    Array
        Fixed size collection of data of the same type

    Slice
        Variable size collection of data of the same type
        A pointer to an array

    Map
        collection of key-value pairs

Modularity
    Before Go 1.13:
        GOPATH
            /bin
                contains all the binaries of the go command line tools
            /pkg
                code of the 3rd packages
            /src
                /github.com
                    /tkmagesh
                        /my-app
                            import "github.com/tkmagesh/pkg-1"
                            app.go
                        /pkg-1
                            code.go
                        /pkg-2
                            code.go

    In Go 1.13 Modules were introduced
    go.mod
        name of the module
            ADVISABE to have the complete repo path as the module name

        minimum go version
        3rd party dependencies

    To create a module
        go mod init <module_name>

    To execute a module
        go mod .

    To create a build of a module
        go build .
        go build -o <binary_name> .

    To install the 3rd party Modules
        go get <module_name>
        go get github.com/fatih/color

    To sync the package details in go.mod file
        go mod tidy

    To download the dependencies in the go.mod file to the module cache
        go mod download

    To localize the dependencies
        go mod vendor

    Other use go mod commands
        go mod graph
        go mod why github.com/mattn/go-colorable
        go mod verify
